## Use Git
 - You must be able to use Git (famously known as GitHub). Here is an amazing article which teaches you the basics of GitHub: [An Intro to Git and GitHub for Beginners (Tutorial)](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners).

## Begin Working
The fun part!
 - **Are you not listed as a contributer on the [contributors page](https://github.com/ProcrastinationNation/Procrasti8x8/graphs/contributors)? Then do the below**
	 This is probably the first time (or have not been accepted yet) you are helping us out, so follow the simple instructions :)
	 - Fork the project (See [Fork a Rep](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) for help).
	 - You can now use the GitHub for desktop app to clone the project to your computer (See [Cloning a Repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for help).
	 - Make changes to the files from the folder where you cloned to with desired tools.
	 - Commit to your fork and push origin (see [Committing and Reviewing Changes to Your Project](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project) for help).
	 - Request a pull (See [Creating a Pull Request from a Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for help).
	 - *You're done! If you are accepted, you will be given the @Pack Contributors role in the discord server. If you want, you can make further changes in your fork (remember to [update from master](https://gist.github.com/santisbon/a1a60db1fb8eecd1beeacd986ae5d3ca) to get the latest content from the main repository). And then you can repeat the proccess (without recreating a fork if you still have it). If we (mainly @Hungie) gains trust in you, you will be able to create a branch and will be added as a contributer on the [contributors page](https://github.com/ProcrastinationNation/Procrasti8x8/graphs/contributors). If that happens, you can follow the instructions below :)*
 - **Are you listed as a contributer on the [contributors page](https://github.com/ProcrastinationNation/Procrasti8x8/graphs/contributors)? Then do the below**
	 - *You are a contributer and you want to help, here is how!*
	 - Create a branch with the name as your **GitHub username, not your discord name** (see [Creating and Deleting Branches Within Your Repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) for help).
	 - You can now use github for desktop to clone your branch to your comuter (see [How Do I Clone a Specific Git Branch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1911109/how-do-i-clone-a-specific-git-branch) for help).
	 - Make changes to the files from the folder where you cloned to with desired tools.
	 - Commit to your branch and push origin (see [Committing and Reviewing Changes to Your Project](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project) for help).
	 - Request a pull (see [About Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for help).
	 - *You are done! If @Hungie accepts you pull request, cool! If not, there will probably be a comment by @Hungie on why it was denied.*
